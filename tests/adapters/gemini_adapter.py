        Compare the following two sentences and return a numeric score between 0 and 1 
        indicating how semantically similar they are. Use the scale below:
        
        Score	Description
        0.0	Completely unrelated; no semantic similarity.
        0.1	Barely related; extremely low similarity.
        0.2	Very weak similarity; almost unrelated.
        0.3	Weak similarity; some minor overlap in meaning.
        0.4	Low similarity; some shared concepts, but mostly different.
        0.5	Moderate similarity; about half of the meaning overlaps.
        0.6	Fair similarity; many shared ideas, but notable differences.
        0.7	High similarity; most of the meaning is the same, some differences.
        0.8	Very high similarity; only small differences; passes your test.
        0.9	Nearly identical; almost exactly the same meaning.
        1.0	Perfect match; identical meaning.
